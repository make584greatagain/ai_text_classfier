"Batteries degrade because chemical reactions inside them gradually become less efficient. The main causes include electrode deterioration where active materials break down during charge cycles, buildup of unwanted compounds that block ion movement, and physical changes like expansion and contraction that damage internal structures. Environmental factors like heat accelerate these processes. Lithium-ion batteries typically lose capacity through a solid electrolyte interphase layer that grows thicker over time, increasing internal resistance and reducing the battery's ability to store and deliver energy.",1
"The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, was the immediate trigger. However, underlying causes like nationalism, imperialism, militarism, and alliance systems created a tense environment that allowed this single event to escalate into a global conflict.",1
"The Cold War (1947–1991) was a geopolitical tension between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. It stemmed from ideological differences (capitalism vs. communism), nuclear arms race, and competing global influence. It involved proxy wars, espionage, and political rivalry but never escalated into direct war.",1

"The Declaration of Independence established America's separation from British rule and articulated revolutionary principles of self-governance and natural rights. It legitimized the American Revolution internationally, helping secure crucial foreign support. By declaring ""all men are created equal,"" it established foundational ideals that, while not immediately realized, inspired future civil rights movements and constitutional developments. The document created a unified national identity among the formerly separate colonies and established precedent for other independence movements worldwide.",1
"Earthquakes happen when tectonic plates, massive rock slabs composing Earth's crust, suddenly slip past each other. This releases stored energy as seismic waves, causing the ground to shake. Fault lines, where these plates meet, are common earthquake locations.",1
"The Amazon Rainforest produces 20% of Earth’s oxygen, absorbs carbon dioxide, and regulates climate. It hosts diverse wildlife and supports global weather patterns. Its destruction accelerates climate change and biodiversity loss, affecting ecosystems worldwide.",1
"Ocean currents regulate global climate by redistributing heat. Warm currents carry tropical heat towards cooler regions, while cold currents bring cooler water to warmer areas. This exchange moderates temperatures, influences precipitation patterns, and drives weather systems, contributing to stable climates in various regions and affecting storm paths globally.",1
"Tsunamis are caused by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, or meteor impacts displacing large water volumes. Prediction involves seismic monitoring, ocean buoys detecting wave changes, and early warning systems. However, precise prediction remains challenging due to the sudden nature of these events.",1
"Deserts form in regions where little precipitation occurs, typically receiving less than 10 inches of rain annually. This happens mainly due to global wind patterns that create dry conditions in specific areas. Regions around 30° latitude (north and south) often become deserts because of descending dry air from atmospheric circulation patterns. Rain shadows occur when mountains block moisture-carrying winds, creating desert conditions on their leeward sides. Some coastal deserts form where cold ocean currents cool air masses, reducing their ability to hold and release moisture.",1
"Inflation stems from rising prices, eroding purchasing power. Causes include: demand exceeding supply, increased production costs, expected future inflation, and an expanded money supply. Essentially, when demand outstrips available goods or production costs increase, prices rise, leading to inflation",1

This process informs product development and marketing strategies, reduces risks, and helps optimize investments. By gathering actionable insights, businesses can make data-driven decisions that enhance their competitive edge and meet consumer demands effectively.",1
"Supply and demand are economic principles: supply is the quantity of a product available, and demand is how much consumers want it. Prices rise when demand exceeds supply and fall when supply exceeds demand. This balance determines market equilibrium, influencing production, consumption, and pricing.",1
"Stock markets influence the economy by reflecting and affecting business investment, consumer spending, and overall economic confidence. When markets rise, companies can raise capital more easily for expansion, while investors feel wealthier and spend more. Market declines can trigger reduced spending and business contraction. Stock indices serve as economic indicators that guide policy decisions, though market performance doesn't always directly correlate with economic fundamentals like employment or production levels.",1
"The bystander effect is a social psychological phenomenon where individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when other people are present. 1  2  The more bystanders, the less likely any individual feels responsible to act, leading to diffusion of responsibility. 1 ",1
"Social media affects mental health both positively and negatively. It connects people but can increase anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem due to comparison and cyberbullying. Excessive use disrupts sleep and focus, while mindful use fosters support and awareness.",1
"Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a psychological theory that ranks human needs in a five-tier model: physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. It suggests that basic needs must be met before individuals can focus on fulfilling higher-level psychological and self-development goals",1
"Habits form through repetition, creating neural pathways in the brain. The basal ganglia, involved in routine behaviors, strengthens these pathways. Cues trigger actions, which, when rewarded, reinforce the habit loop. Over time, this process becomes automatic, requiring less conscious thought.",1
"Déjà vu is that strange feeling of familiarity with a new experience. It likely occurs due to a memory processing glitch where the brain incorrectly signals that a current event has happened before. Possible causes include neural pathway misfiring, parallel processing in memory systems, or slight delays in perception that create a false sense of remembering the present moment.",1
"Free will posits that choices are independent, allowing alternative actions. Determinism argues all events, including choices, are predetermined by prior causes. Free will suggests genuine choice; determinism, inevitability. The debate centers on whether choices are truly free or merely the result of preceding events.",1
"Utilitarianism defines morality by the greatest happiness principle—actions are right if they maximize overall happiness and minimize suffering. It focuses on consequences, weighing benefits and harms to determine ethical choices.",1
"Existentialism is a philosophical movement emphasizing individual freedom, responsibility, and the creation of personal meaning. It posits that life has no inherent purpose, so each person must forge their own path, often confronting the absurdity of existence and embracing authentic choices.",1
"The ""golden rule,"" treating others as you want to be treated, promotes empathy, fairness, and mutual respect. It’s a universal ethical principle found in many cultures and religions, fostering harmonious relationships and reducing conflict by encouraging consideration of others' perspectives and well-being.",1
"The paradox of tolerance, introduced by philosopher Karl Popper, states that unlimited tolerance leads to the disappearance of tolerance itself. If a society tolerates intolerant views or groups without limits, these intolerant forces may eventually destroy the tolerant society. To preserve tolerance, Popper argued that societies must reserve the right to not tolerate intolerance, especially when it threatens the existence of tolerance itself.",1

"Symbolism adds depth to storytelling by using objects, characters, or events to represent larger ideas, themes, or emotions. It engages readers, encourages interpretation, and conveys complex messages subtly. Symbolism enriches narratives, making them more memorable and impactful by connecting the story to universal human experiences.",1
"Words develop multiple meanings through several natural language processes. Over time, meanings extend through metaphorical usage, cultural shifts, or adoption into specialized fields. Some words acquire new definitions when borrowed across languages or through generalization from specific to broader usage. Different geographic regions might develop unique meanings for the same word. This linguistic phenomenon, called polysemy, allows languages to remain efficient by reusing familiar sounds rather than creating entirely new words for each concept.",1
"The Renaissance marked a rebirth of classical ideals, emphasizing humanism, realism, and perspective. Artists like Leonardo and Michelangelo pioneered techniques, shifting focus from religious to secular subjects. 2  Patronage flourished, fostering innovation, and the period's influence on subsequent art movements is profound.",1

"A balanced diet provides essential nutrients, supports healthy weight management, and improves energy levels. It reduces the risk of chronic diseases, boosts the immune system, and aids proper bodily functions. Additionally, it supports mental clarity, digestive health, and overall well-being, contributing to a longer, healthier life.",1
"Stress triggers the ""fight or flight"" response, releasing cortisol and adrenaline. Short-term, it boosts alertness, but chronic stress harms the body: weakens the immune system, increases heart disease risk, disrupts digestion, and causes sleep problems, anxiety, and depression. Managing stress is crucial for overall health.",1
"Herd immunity occurs when enough people become immune to a disease, making it difficult for the pathogen to spread. It protects vulnerable populations, prevents outbreaks, reduces disease burden, and can help eliminate infectious diseases. It can be achieved through vaccination or natural infection, though vaccination is safer.",1
"The term eclipse is most often used to describe either a solar eclipse, when the Moon's shadow crosses the Earth's surface, or a lunar eclipse, when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow. However, it can also refer to such events beyond the Earth–Moon system: for example, a planet moving into the shadow cast by one of its moons, a moon passing into the shadow cast by its host planet, or a moon passing into the shadow of another moon. A binary star system can also produce eclipses if the plane of the orbit of its constituent stars intersects the observer's position.",0
"An astronomical year lasts slightly less than 365⁠ 1/4⁠ days. The historic Julian calendar has three common years of 365 days followed by a leap year of 366 days, by extending February to 29 days rather than the common 28. The Gregorian calendar, the world's most widely used civil calendar, makes a further adjustment for the small error in the Julian algorithm. Each leap year has 366 days instead of 365. This extra leap day occurs in each year that is a multiple of 4, except for years evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400.",0
"Auroras are the result of disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere caused by the solar wind.

The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water and is the primary component of Earth's hydrosphere and is thereby essential to life on Earth.",0
"Tsunami waves do not resemble normal undersea currents or sea waves because their wavelength is far longer. Rather than appearing as a breaking wave, a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide. For this reason, it is often referred to as a tidal wave, although this usage is not favoured by the scientific community because it might give the false impression of a causal relationship between tides and tsunamis.",0
"A desert is a landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions create unique biomes and ecosystems. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions, where little precipitation occurs, and which are sometimes called polar deserts or ""cold deserts"".",0
"By the nineteenth century, economists categorised three separate factors that cause a rise or fall in the price of goods: a change in the value or production costs of the good, a change in the price of money which then was usually a fluctuation in the commodity price of the metallic content in the currency, and currency depreciation resulting from an increased supply of currency relative to the quantity of redeemable metal backing the currency.",0
