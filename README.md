# AI text classfier

Our project have trained several models and built a website for easier user access. We also manually collected an independent dataset to test the model generalization capability. We list the directories those subprojects reside.

- Baseline models: demo_ensemble
- Fine-tuned models: demo_finetuning
- Bert model: BERT
- Independent dataset: independent_dataset_drawing
- Website: ai_detect

How to train those models can be found at:

- Baseline models: demo_ensemble/readme.md
- Fine-tuned models: demo_finetuning/readme.md
- Bert model: BERT/readme.md

The instruction to test the models against the independent dataset can be found at:

- Independent dataset: independent_dataset_drawing/readme.md

For the user-friendly website, you can run it by docker. Refer to the description at:

- Website: ai_detect/readme.md
