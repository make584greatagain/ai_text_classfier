% -- Tokenization, stop-word removal, TF-IDF --
Standard NLP preprocessing was applied, including tokenization, stop\textendash word
removal, and text normalization. We then employed TF–IDF
(Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert text into
numeric features, emphasizing terms most informative for classification.
