% -- Grid search over vectorizer + model hyper-parameters --
Both vectorizer parameters (e.g., \emph{n}\textendash gram ranges, TFâ€“IDF
max\_features) and model hyperparameters (regularization strength, class
weights, penalties) were systematically optimized via grid search. This
comprehensive tuning improved overall accuracy and generalization.
