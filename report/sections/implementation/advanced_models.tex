\subsection{Advanced Models}  % -- 3.D --
% -- CatBoost, LightGBM, Transformers (BERT) --
We next evaluated more sophisticated techniques, specifically
CatBoost, LightGBM, and a transformer model (BERT).
CatBoost was selected for its robustness with sparse, categorical text features,
while transformer models were chosen for their ability to capture deep semantic
and contextual nuances.
